# WEEK 4 Assignment - Code Quiz
In this weeks task we were required to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Starting with a blank canvas, we needed to build out the HTML and CSS and then use JavaScript to dynamically updated base HTML and CSS code. 


## Notes 
While there were a lot of tutorials avaliable on creating a simple quiz with JavaScript, with trial and error it became clear not all were suitble. It was still valuable to have gone through this process. There was also an number of additional elements required for this project, i wasnt success at integrating them with my first two quiz attempts, so i revised the core quiz fucntionality. 


## Questions/Challenges
Still finding it challenge to structure the intial planning stages of breaking down the projects into manageble parts. Will be talking to the tutors this week in the best way to set myself up.
